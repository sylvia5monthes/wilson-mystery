The Missing Egg: A Wilson Original is a multimedia work that integrates text, images, and music into a digital medium. The player starts in Wilson’s center hallway and is given directions to make scrambled eggs, which is when they discover that an egg has gone missing. After this revelation, the player must explore the first floor and search for clues that will unlock more actions that they can take, gradually bringing them closer to discovering the egg’s whereabouts and the thief.
